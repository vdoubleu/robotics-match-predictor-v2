# Robotics match predictor 2: Electric Boogaloo

This repository will actually be more than just a simple robotics match predictor like the previous version. It will actually be a collection of various models that I have explored to tackle this unique problem.

The problem I wish to solve is the following: Given a series of statistics about an alliance and/or its teams, to what extent can I predict the outcome of a match.

I attempt to approach this problem by first gathering data from vexDB (a collection of statistics of various teams and alliances scraped from the official VEX competition website). All the scripts to do so are in /data as of right now.
