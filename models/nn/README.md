# Neural Nets

This is where I'm placing all the neural net models that I have created to try and predict the outcome of matches.

## Neural Net 1
This my first attempt at creating a neural net for this problem from scratch using tensorflow. This is mostly for exploration and I don't really have many expectations for this. All I'm really hoping for is working code.

## Neural Net 2
After some additional testing, I realised additional training data was required. After tripling the amount of data I had, I then decided to do some more testing and fiddling with keras to prototype a basic model that managed to hit over 75% accuracy using just the teams wins and losses.
